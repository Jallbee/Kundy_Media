            Elden Ring is a great game.

I will say that this game is not for everyone's tastes so this is not a complete blanket statement and no one should ever have to defend their dislike of the game for any reason.
Now the gameplay is what loses most players from playing completely through or even from picking up the game at all. To boil it down the player is building a character for combat and has access to a massive variety of weapons, shields, spells and items to assist you. Every weapon has a moveset for how your character can swing them to harm the enemy and every enemy has a moveset as well for how they will attack you. This leads to the main crux of the gameplay which is to size up the enemy, learn how they operate and how they will come after you and to strategize around killing them before they kill you. 
Veteran players liken the combat to a dance or a rhythm game as enemies and bosses will likely fall into a pattern and can be predicted if you can practice the flow of the combative dance they show to you. However if you try to fight the flow and go off rhythm or just try to brute force the enemy with no regards to any defense, you will be hurt or killed, these are gods and monsters you are fighting and you are just a person.
Whether you can conquer this flow or not will determine whether you can enjoy the game. The same as with a standard rhythm game, the joy comes from learning the pattern and flow and mastering the song. The only difference is that the song of this game happens to be a dragon, a 8ft tall abomination with 12 arms or a literal God.

            Baulders Gate 3 was game of the year in 2023. It was my first attempt of a game that is D&D like, when I first decied tom play this because everyone else was I had no idea what to expect walking into it. I had orginally started as a very light hearted character who just wanted to find the good in everyone nad every situation my party was in. As the game progresses and gets darker I found myslef making choices none of my friends ever expected. All thought in my 112 hours into the game and i havent quite finished it yet it is hands down in my top 3 games ever played. I can not wait to finish it and start over as a diffrent character.

             Easily one of the greatest games of all time. Sure the graphics don't seem like much now but back in the day those PS2 graphics were groundbreaking! The remaster of X/X-2 didn't do too bad of a job ramping up the beauty of macalania lake, the sky of zanarkand, and the blitzball stadiums. The music is a full experience, incredibly orchestrated to go along with the story. Now the story is easily the best part and in my opinion an incredible journey through time, love & destruction.
